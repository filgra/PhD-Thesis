# **Abstract**

This PhD Thesis is focused on pricing and risk management techniques for long dated
contingent claims where no complete market is available for hedging purposes. The problem
is approached from a potential life-insurer standpoint, with the purpose of selling
long dated guarantees on a certain investment fund portfolio. With this in mind, we aim
to investigate and define some best practices to design and build a strong risk management
framework. The First Chapter of the Thesis sets the ground with the definition
and review of Variable Annuities, while also tackling practical topics such as risk management
practices (hedging) and performance measurement. The Second Chapter deep
dives into more practical issues, such as the definition of possible models to use to model
the underlying risk factors, as well as the implementation of a suitable hedging strategy
based on greeks for such long dated contingent claims. Finally, the Third Chapter introduces
a more innovative approach for pricing and risk management, by combining risk
minimization hedging with Neural Networks.
